# Hello-world
First repository

My name is CJ and I am starting my journey towards learning web development. I have always been interested in web design and have taken high school classes which focused on creating basic websites through coding with HTML. These courses also let me experiment with Dreamweaver and let me create more complicated websites. But, that was years ago and I am re-learning/teaching myself the skills i will need through internet resources. I am looking forward to expressing my creativity and problem-solving skills in both the layout of the website, as well as the coding that goes in to making everything work.

Wish me luck!
